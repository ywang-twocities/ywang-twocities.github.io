I'm a **PhD candidate** in [Geospatial Data Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/)  
at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/).

My research explores the intersection of **geospatial AI**, **data ethics**, and **urban analytics**,  
with emphasis on *positioning*, *navigation*, and *fairness in spatial data*.
