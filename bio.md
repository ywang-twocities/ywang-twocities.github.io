I'm a **final-year PhD candidate** in the [Geospatial Data Science Group](https://gdsglasgow.github.io/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/).  

Before commencing my PhD, I obtained **Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in telecommunications** and spent over six years working in France as a telecom engineer on national transmission networks. This experience deepened my curiosity about how large-scale network data reflect societal dynamics and reveal latent spatial or behavioural patterns relevant to urban applications.  

My current research explores the intersection of **geospatial AI**, **data ethics**, and **urban analytics**, with an emphasis on *positioning*, *navigation*, and *fairness in spatial data*. I am particularly interested in understanding how AI systems embed and reproduce geographic biases and how such biases affect the accessibility, quality, and equity of geospatial information.
